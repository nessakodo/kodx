üßø XP Ring ‚Äî Motion, Clarity, and Engagement Fix

Current Issue:

The level ring appears static and is unclear whether it's animated, interactive, or proportionally accurate

Visually disconnected from the XP value and feels disconnected from the rest of the XP story

‚úÖ Desired Enhancements

Constant Motion:

Make the progress ring subtly animate in a slow clockwise motion to create a sense of rhythm and growth ‚Äî even when static

This adds a meditative, cyber-zen flow to the UI

CSS (SVG or circular loader logic suggestion):

css
Copy
Edit
@keyframes rotate-ring {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}

.xp-ring-wrapper {
  animation: rotate-ring 20s linear infinite;
}
Level Clarity:

Keep the level number inside the circle, but:

Increase spacing between LEVEL and number

Reduce font size slightly for balance

Consider adding ‚ÄúLevel 2‚Äù as text outside the ring instead for cleaner design

XP Progress Integration:

Below or beside the ring, add a subtle animated bar or glow-pulse to represent XP progress numerically (e.g., 1250 XP / 2000 XP)

Or: make the ring glow slightly brighter the closer to level-up (85%+)

Optional Bonus (future scope):

Add hover/click state to reveal:

XP source breakdown (e.g. ‚Äú600 XP from Labs, 650 from Projects‚Äù)

üìê Responsive UX Notes

Ring should animate fluidly on desktop

Use fallback static ring for low-power mobile mode if needed

üîî Notification Bell UI Fix (Top Nav)

Issue:
The purple dot is detached from the bell icon and floats awkwardly (see screenshot). The interaction feels disconnected and lacks standard notification UX behavior.

‚úÖ Desired Behavior

Notification Dot:

Attach a small, centered dot to the top-right corner of the bell icon container

Use a consistent notification badge color (e.g. #bb86fc or similar)

The dot should only appear when there are unread notifications

CSS Suggestion:

css
Copy
Edit
.notification-icon {
  position: relative;
}

.notification-dot {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
  background-color: #bb86fc;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
Notification Modal:

Clicking the bell icon should toggle a modal dropdown panel (not hover)

The modal should:

Render a list of recent actions (likes, comments, follows, system announcements)

Include a button or link: ‚ÄúView All in Dashboard‚Äù

Be closable on outside click or escape key

The modal should disappear when you click outside or re-click the bell

Component Logic:

‚òê Use state to track open/closed (e.g., isNotificationsOpen)

‚òê Fetch mock data or hook to Supabase activity log later

‚òê Clear unread state after viewing modal
