You are a full-stack developer and UI/UX expert helping to build out the “KODΞX Resource Vault,” a dark-glassmorphic resource hub for a mindful cybersecurity learning platform. Use the existing JSON structure as your foundation and follow this creative/technical brief:

🌌 **Site Aesthetic & UX Goals**:
- Futuristic, cyber-zen visual theme with soft glow UI
- Rounded glassmorphic containers, soft grid backgrounds
- Responsive cards with subtle hover animations
- Readable monospaced or spaced fonts (e.g., Orbitron)
- Light visual feedback on interactions (badges, modals)

📚 **Page Purpose**:
This is a multi-section, modular resource vault that supports:
- Beginner-to-advanced users in learning cybersecurity and creative coding
- Hands-on exploration via Labs, Projects, and devlogs
- Curated vaults of videos, PDFs, tools, browser extensions, and templates

🧠 **Content Needs**:
Expand each section with deeper educational content and great UI/UX:

1. **Vault UI Enhancements**:
   - Show resource cards by type: PDF, Notion, GitHub, YouTube, etc.
   - Each card should have icon, description, CTA (e.g., “Open PDF”, “Watch”, “Copy Template”)
   - Add ability to filter by topic (Git, Web Security, Quantum, etc.)

2. **Pathways for Mastery**:
   - Render tiers as vertical cards or a progress tree
   - Let users save/track their progress per tier
   - Add a “Suggested Next Step” CTA for each level

3. **Newsletter & Digest**:
   - Include mock input field and “Subscribed” confirmation state
   - Add subtle moon-cycle icon or animation for seasonal flair

4. **Learn More**:
   - Animate buttons on hover
   - Use gentle background glow behind each button

5. **Extra UX Features**:
   - Sticky sidebar for navigation between sections
   - "Add to Vault" buttons on Labs/Projects to bookmark content
   - Toggle between card and list view for accessibility

🧩 **Optional Enhancements**:
- Include a “Recently Added” sort toggle
- Add resource ratings or badges (e.g., “Trusted”, “New”)
- Add floating “Suggest a Resource” button linking to a submission form
- Support markdown-based resource descriptions and citations

⚙️ **Tech Stack Preference**:
Use HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JS/React. Ensure semantic structure and scalable code. Support a dark mode theme by default. Responsive on all screen sizes. Icons should be accessible and thematic (Font Awesome or Lucide).

🎯 **Goal**:
Deliver an interactive resource vault that invites curiosity, supports long-term tech growth, and matches the immersive UX of the KODΞX platform.

Start by expanding the current JSON and providing a full component suite.
