Please apply the following refinements across the entire KODΞX platform to enhance legibility, emotional tone, visual polish, and secure interaction logic.

TYPOGRAPHY & BRANDING

Increase letter-spacing across all text using the Orbitron font

Ensure the “KODEX” wordmark glow/gradient styling is applied consistently in:

Navbar (do not add weight)

Footer

Hero sections

GLOBAL BUTTONS

Replace all primary action buttons (e.g., “Create Account”, “Start Lab”) with this new gradient glassmorphic style for consistent aesthetic:

.cta-button {
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
border: 1px solid rgba(158, 207, 255, 0.3);
border-radius: 16px;
padding: 0.9rem 2rem;
font-size: 1rem;
font-weight: 600;
color: #ffffff;
cursor: pointer;
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(158, 207, 255, 0.1);
transition: all 0.4s ease;
letter-spacing: 0.08em;
text-transform: uppercase;
}

.cta-button:hover {
background: rgba(158, 207, 255, 0.1);
box-shadow: 0 0 25px rgba(158, 207, 255, 0.3), 0 0 40px rgba(136, 201, 183, 0.2);
border-color: rgba(158, 207, 255, 0.6);
}

TASK & QUIZ INTERACTIONS

Style Lab/Project task bubbles with:

Glassmorphic background

Glow ring on hover/complete

Subtle microanimation on toggle

Style Quiz cards with:

Slight elevation + glow outline on focus

Interactive feedback on option selection

Clear, Orbitron-styled questions with consistent spacing

HOMEPAGE LAYOUT

Make “Next Lab Drop” card full-width to match page columns

Enhance visibility with glow border, timer, and Add to Calendar button

FOOTER SIMPLIFICATION

Remove all content section columns: Labs, Projects, Community, About

Keep only:

KODEX wordmark + 1-line description: “A platform for mindful technologists building secure, ethical, and intentional digital systems.”

Social icons: Discord, YouTube, GitHub

Bottom links: Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Code of Conduct

BACKGROUND & GRID

Set site-wide background to a subtle radial blue-gray “mist” gradient

Overlay a terminal-style grid:

Slightly enlarged grid units

Low-opacity white lines with light blur/glassmorphic effect

Ensure all foreground elements remain highly legible and focused

NAVBAR

Transparent on page load

Adds backdrop blur + elevation on scroll

Includes glowing “KODEX” wordmark

Navigation and sign in/out logic as previously scoped

LOGIC & AUTH BEHAVIOR

Only logged-in users can:

See “Start” or “Continue” buttons on Labs/Projects

Like, comment, or post in the Forum

View the Dashboard or Notifications

Admin posts in Forum:

Must be visually distinct (e.g., badge highlight or elevated frame)

XP ring should animate constantly on the dashboard only

Notifications must show only when logged in

RESPONSIVENESS & ACCESSIBILITY

Ensure layout and animations degrade gracefully on mobile

Maintain high contrast ratios and keyboard navigation across all components

All animations should enhance clarity, not distract
