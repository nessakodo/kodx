Please apply the following updates across the KODΞX platform build to align with the design vision, enhance clarity, and ensure accessibility:

Typography & Visual Styling

Increase letter-spacing globally for all text elements using the Orbitron font for improved readability

Ensure consistent use of the “KODEX” gradient/glow wordmark style (used in header) in:

Navbar (without bold weight)

Footer

Hero sections

Improve global font and spacing alignment for better UI/UX balance and legibility

Component Enhancements

Tasks (Lab/Project checklists): Style each task bubble with a soft glassmorphic background, clear hover/focus/checked states, and rounded outline glow to make interaction aesthetically satisfying

Quizzes: Style each question bubble and option with subtle elevation, animated selection feedback, and orbitron-style titles

"Next Lab Drop" card: Make it full-width (to match page columns) and give it visual weight as a key homepage module

Layout & Footer

Footer:

Simplify: remove "Labs", "Projects", "Community", and "About" sections

Keep only:

One-line platform description (cyber-zen learning ecosystem, etc.)

Social icons (Discord, YouTube, GitHub)

Background:

Use blue-gray “misty” radial gradient as background

Apply a subtle glassmorphic terminal grid overlay

Increase grid unit size to improve rhythm and harmony

Navbar:

Transparent by default

Apply blurred glass background and slight elevation when scrolling

Interactivity & Logic

Lab/Project cards:

“Start” or “Continue” buttons only appear if user is logged in

Forum:

Only logged-in users can like, comment, or post

Admin posts should be visually distinct (e.g., glow border or pinned badge indicator)

Behavioral Logic (already in scope, but clarify)

Labs and Projects should store progress and dynamically switch button states:

“Start Lab” → “Continue Lab” → “Completed”

Dashboard XP ring and devlog entries must only be visible to logged-in users

Notifications in navbar should only appear after login

🧪 QA Note

Please check for consistent behavior across mobile/tablet/desktop viewports and confirm that animation/glow styles don’t compromise accessibility or legibility.
