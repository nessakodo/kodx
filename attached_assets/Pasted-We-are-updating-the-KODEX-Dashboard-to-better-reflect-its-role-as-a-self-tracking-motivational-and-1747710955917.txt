We are updating the KODEX Dashboard to better reflect its role as a self-tracking, motivational, and aesthetically aligned experience for mindful technologists.

📍 Key Changes to Implement:

🚫 Remove Emoji Usage

Do not use emojis in the Recent Activity or Notifications section

Replace all visual indicators with iconography or styled badge assets (see below)

🧿 XP Ring & Progress Bar Enhancements

Remove the current ring around the avatar

Create a floating or framed animated XP ring separate from the avatar

Should animate slowly or pulse subtly

Reflect total XP with visual fill

Add a secondary progress bar (under the XP ring) that clearly shows:
→ XP to next level (e.g. “1250 XP — 25% to Level 3”)

🏆 Badges Section (Expanded)

Move badges to their own section below XP or in a side column

Display a grid of max 5 badges per level

Each badge should:

Use a glowing glassmorphic button design (no emoji)

Show badge name + hover description

On mobile: clicking a badge opens a modal with title, XP value, unlock requirements

Add pagination or tabs to view:

“Unlocked” badges

“Locked” (next level) badges

“All” badges

🔄 Recent Activity Feed

Sync Recent Activity with data from the Notification system (e.g. new lab drops, comments, XP gains)

Remove emoji prefixes

Each entry should include:

Action summary (e.g. “You completed 2/5 tasks in…”)

Linked object (e.g. link to that project or lab)

Timestamp (e.g. “3 days ago”)

Enable pagination if activity exceeds 5 entries

🔔 Notifications Panel

Leave as-is functionally, but confirm that all events shown in the Dashboard are also visible in the Notification dropdown

Link "View all in Dashboard" should scroll or route to this same Recent Activity section

🧠 Optional for Replit AI or Designer:

Where badge titles, descriptions, or recent activity phrasing is unclear, intelligently fill with descriptive microcopy aligned to the KODEX tone:

Tone = Cyber-Zen, intentional, technically clear, poetic when fitting

Avoid excessive excitement or gamification. Think: “You advanced. Well done.” not “Awesome job!”

Badge Descriptions: Include purpose (e.g. “Awarded for completing your first project using GitHub Pages.”)

📌 Bonus: Animate the XP ring slightly on hover and level-up
📌 Keep Orbitron font with increased letter-spacing for all XP/badge elements

Please align with existing design language used in:

Labs and Projects cards

Navbar notification dropdown

XP and badge progress styling
