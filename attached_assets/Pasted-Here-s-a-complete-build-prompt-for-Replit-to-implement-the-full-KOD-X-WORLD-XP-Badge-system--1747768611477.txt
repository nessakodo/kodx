Here’s a complete **build prompt for Replit** to implement the full **KODΞX.WORLD XP + Badge system**, structured for clarity, scalability, and thematic consistency.

---

## 🛠️ REPLIT PROMPT (BUILD THIS)

### 🧩 Project: `badges-xp-system`

> Build a fully integrated **XP + Badge system** page for KODΞX.WORLD, including:

* **XP curve logic**
* **Level milestone unlocks**
* **Badge reveal system**
* **Dynamic user badge viewer**
* **Preloaded `levels.json` and `badges.json`**
* **Modals for level-ups and new badges**
* **Mobile-responsive badge gallery**

---

### ✅ Features To Implement

#### 📈 1. XP Curve Logic (Level Progression)

Use this XP function:

```js
function getXPForLevel(level) {
  return Math.round(100 * Math.pow(level, 1.5));
}
```

Precompute XP for levels 1–50 and store in `levels.json`.
Render current XP, XP-to-next, and level progression bar.

#### 🧠 2. Level Data (JSON Source)

Use this format for `levels.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "level": 1,
    "title": "Digital Initiate",
    "message": "Your journey begins. The path to digital sovereignty opens.",
    "xpRequired": 0
  },
  {
    "level": 5,
    "title": "Code Explorer",
    "message": "You've begun shaping the systems around you.",
    "xpRequired": 559
  },
  {
    "level": 10,
    "title": "Circuit Voyager",
    "message": "The tools have become extensions of your thought.",
    "xpRequired": 3162
  },
  {
    "level": 15,
    "title": "Signal Scribe",
    "message": "You now translate chaos into clarity.",
    "xpRequired": 6510
  },
  {
    "level": 20,
    "title": "Protocol Architect",
    "message": "You no longer just build—you design with intention.",
    "xpRequired": 8944
  },
  {
    "level": 30,
    "title": "Cyber Sage",
    "message": "Systems reveal themselves to you as patterns.",
    "xpRequired": 16431
  },
  {
    "level": 50,
    "title": "Sovereignty Keeper",
    "message": "You code with purpose. You lead with awareness.",
    "xpRequired": 35355
  }
]
```

---

#### 🏅 3. Badge Gallery (Page: `/badges`)

Use `badges.json` to populate a badge viewer.

```json
{
  "id": "lab_starter",
  "name": "Lab Starter",
  "description": "Completed your first lab",
  "category": "labs",
  "rarity": "common",
  "timestampEarned": null
}
```

🧩 Include:

* Filtering by category or rarity
* Hover card reveal with criteria + glow
* Timestamp formatting (`e.g. "Earned May 20, 2025"`)

---

### ✨ 4. Modal System

#### Level-Up Modal:

```jsx
<LevelUpModal
  level={3}
  title="Circuit Voyager"
  message="The tools have become extensions of your thought."
  onClose={...}
/>
```

#### Badge Reveal Modal:

```jsx
<BadgeModal
  badge={{
    name: "Mindful Coder",
    description: "Your code flows not from thought alone, but from presence.",
    reward: "Reflection timer with ambient sound"
  }}
  onClose={...}
/>
```

These should:

* Feature glassmorphic effects
* Include soft XP ring animation
* Use a subtle ambient glow gradient

---

### 🌐 5. Page: `/levels`

Render all levels in a scrollable vertical timeline:

* Show user current level with a progress dot
* Allow preview of unlocked wisdom at each level

---

### 📊 6. User Profile Integration

On `/dashboard` or `/profile`, integrate:

* XP ring
* Next level tooltip
* Badge strip carousel (with scroll)

If user has no XP or badges, use:

> **Your path is unwritten.**
> Begin your first Lab to earn XP and unlock your digital evolution.

---

### 💎 Bonus Styling Requirements

* Use Orbitron and Inter fonts
* Match existing theme: `#9ecfff`, `#88c9b7`, `#f4ca64`, `#0e0e0e`
* Use animated gradient glows for rare/epic/legendary badges
* Respect mobile breakpoints

---

Would you like me to also generate:

* Tailwind class structure
* Supabase table schema for user XP + badges
* React `BadgeCard.tsx` component base?

Let’s activate the system.
