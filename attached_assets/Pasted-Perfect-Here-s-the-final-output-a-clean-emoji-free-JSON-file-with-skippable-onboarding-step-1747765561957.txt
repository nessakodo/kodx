Perfect. Here’s the final output: a **clean, emoji-free JSON file** with **skippable onboarding steps**. It’s fully compatible with either:

1. 🌀 **A modal carousel** (like Swiper.js, Radix Dialog, or Reakit)
2. 💡 **Tailwind-styled walkthrough banners** shown inline or at dashboard entry

## 🎨 Tailwind Modal Carousel Integration (Starter Code Stub)

If using a carousel UI (like Swiper):

```tsx
<Dialog open={showOnboarding}>
  <DialogContent className="bg-black/60 border border-[#88c9b7]/30 backdrop-blur-xl rounded-xl shadow-2xl text-white p-6 max-w-lg mx-auto">
    <h2 className="font-orbitron text-2xl text-[#9ecfff] mb-4">{currentStep.title}</h2>
    <p className="text-[#c0c0c0] mb-6">{currentStep.body}</p>
    <div className="flex justify-between">
      {currentStep.skippable && (
        <button onClick={skipTour} className="text-sm text-[#b0b0b0] hover:underline">Skip</button>
      )}
      <button onClick={nextStep} className="bg-gradient-to-r from-[#9ecfff] to-[#88c9b7] text-black font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded-xl">
        {currentStep.action}
      </button>
    </div>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

## ✅ Implementation Notes

* Store completion in localStorage or Supabase `users.tourComplete: true`
* Offer reactivation in settings: “Revisit Tour”
* You can pass this JSON into your React state or fetch from Supabase/table

Let me know if you’d like:

* Tailwind banner versions (like dismissible alerts per page)
* Figma wireframe
* Accompanying `tourComplete` logic in Supabase schema

Ready to push it live when you are.
